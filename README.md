# London Santander Bike-share Prediction
Bike-sharing has garnered considerable interest in recent years for its role in enhancing first/last-mile connectivity and reducing the environmental footprint of transportation (Fishman, 2016; Ricci, 2015; Shaheen et al., 2010). These benefits made it a widely embraced strategy within urban and transportation planning frameworks to advance sustainability objectives and encourage eco-friendly commuting practices.

As bike-sharing continues to gain traction, accurately predicting bike usage becomes imperative. London, where bike-sharing has become an integral component of the transportation landscape, presents an excellent case study for this task. The Barclays Cycle Hire scheme was launched in 2010 jointly by TfL and Barclays Bank to increase cycling rates and provide a convenient alternative to traditional modes of transportation (TfL, 2010). The scheme was later rebranded as Santander Cycles under Santander Bank's stewardship in 2016. Since its inception, the bike-sharing system has witnessed a steady rise in usage, surpassing 10 million trips annually by 2019 (TfL, 2020). 

This research aims to develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm that accurately predicts the hourly bike-share demands using temporal and weather-related features, thereby enabling more effective management of Londonâ€™s bike-share systems. The dataset of research is created from bike-share, weather and UK holiday data, obtained from the TfL open-data, freemeteo.com, and gov.uk respectively. The final algorithm uses XGBoost and is able to predict bike-demand with a mean absolute error of 198 bikes on a city level, highlighting the accuracy and effectiveness of the designed model.
